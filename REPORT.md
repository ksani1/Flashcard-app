## Summary and Reflection
In developing the Flashcards app using Flutter and the SQFlite package for local database management, I focused on creating a user-friendly interface with efficient CRUD operations for managing decks and flashcards. A key decision was to separate database interactions from UI components to enhance maintainability, though I encountered challenges with optimizing mp question randomization and managing app state. Despite these hurdles, I enjoyed the creative process of designing the user interface and learned valuable lessons about asynchronous programming with SQFlite. In retrospect, I wish I had delved deeper into state management solutions prior to starting the project, as this knowledge would have streamlined my development process and improved the overall user experience.
